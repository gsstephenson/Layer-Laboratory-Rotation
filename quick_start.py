## Predict outputs for a genome interval (reference genome)

For convenience, you can also directly make predictions for a human reference
genome sequence specified by a **genomic interval**. For example, let's predict
RNA-seq for tissue 'Right liver lobe' in a 1MB region of Chromosome 19 around
the gene *CYP2B6*, which encodes an enzyme involved in drug metabolism, and is
primarily expressed in the liver.

We first load up a GTF file containing gene and transcript locations as
annotated by GENCODE (more information on GTF format

gtf_transcripts = gene_annotation.filter_to_longest_transcript(gtf_transcripts)
transcript_extractor = transcript_utils.TranscriptExtractor(gtf_transcripts)

"""And then fetch the gene's location as a `genome.Interval` object by passing
either its `gene_symbol` (HGNC naming convention) or ENSEMBL `gene_id`:

"""We can resize it to a length compatible with the model:"""

interval = interval.resize(dna_client.SEQUENCE_LENGTH_1MB)

"""The `.resize()` method adjusts the interval to the specified width by expanding
(or contracting) around its original center. Note that
`dna_model.predict_interval()` interprets this resizing as an expansion of the
actual genomic sequence rather than padding tokens.

## Predict variant effects

We can predict the effect of a variant on a specific output type and tissue by
making predictions for the reference (REF) and alternative (ALT) allele
sequences.

We specify the variant by defining a `genome.Variant` object. The specific
variant below is a known variant affecting gene expression in colon tissue:
"""

variant = genome.Variant(
    chromosome='chr22',
    position=36201698,
    reference_bases='A',  # Can differ from the true reference genome base.
    alternate_bases='C',
)

"""Next, we define the interval over which to make the REF and ALT predictions. A
quick way to get a `genome.Interval` from a `genome.Variant` is by calling
`.reference_interval`, which we can resize to a model-compatible sequence
length:
"""

interval = variant.reference_interval.resize(dna_client.SEQUENCE_LENGTH_1MB)

"""We then use `predict_variant` to get the REF and ALT RNA-seq predictions in the
interval for "Colon - Transverse" tissue (`UBERON:0001157`):
"""

variant_output = dna_model.predict_variant(
    interval=interval,
    variant=variant,
    requested_outputs=[dna_client.OutputType.RNA_SEQ],
    ontology_terms=['UBERON:0001157'],
)  # Colon - Transverse.

"""We can plot the predicted REF and ALT values as a single plot and zoom in on the
affected gene to better visualise the variant's effect on gene expression:
"""

longest_transcripts = transcript_extractor.extract(interval)

plot_components.plot(
    [
        plot_components.TranscriptAnnotation(longest_transcripts),
        plot_components.OverlaidTracks(
            tdata={
                'REF': variant_output.reference.rna_seq,
                'ALT': variant_output.alternate.rna_seq,
            },
            colors={'REF': 'dimgrey', 'ALT': 'red'},
        ),
    ],
    interval=variant_output.reference.rna_seq.interval.resize(2**15),
    # Annotate the location of the variant as a vertical line.
    annotations=[plot_components.VariantAnnotation([variant], alpha=0.8)],
)
plt.show()

"""We see that the ALT allele (base 'C' at position 36201698) is associated with
both lower expression and an exon skipping event in the *APOL4* gene on the
negative strand. Note that we can ignore the uppermost line plot which shows a
very minimal predicted amount of expression on the positive DNA strand (check
the y axis scales). It is possible to adjust the y axes limits, see
[visualization basics](https://www.alphagenomedocs.com/visualization_library_basics.html#visualization-library-basics)
and
[library documentation](https://www.alphagenomedocs.com/api/visualization.html).

## Scoring the effect of a genetic variant

Scoring the effect of a genetic variant involves making predictions for the REF
and ALT sequences and aggregating the track signal. This is implemented in
`score_variant`, which uses specific `variant_scorer` configs for aggregation.

We provide a set of recommended variant scoring configurations as a dictionary
(`variant_scorers.RECOMMENDED_VARIANT_SCORERS`), covering all output types,
which we have assessed for their performance at domain-specific tasks. See the
[variant scoring documentation](https://www.alphagenomedocs.com/variant_scoring.html)
for more information. Here is a quick demo:
"""

variant_scorer = variant_scorers.RECOMMENDED_VARIANT_SCORERS['RNA_SEQ']

variant_scores = dna_model.score_variant(
    interval=interval, variant=variant, variant_scorers=[variant_scorer]
)

"""The returned `variant_scores` is a list of length 1 because we only specified 1
scorer:
"""

len(variant_scores)

"""The actual scores per variant are in `AnnData` format, which is a way of
annotating data (the numerical scores) with additional information about the
rows and columns.
"""

variant_scores = variant_scores[0]
variant_scores

"""`AnnData` objects have the following components:

<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/anndata.png"><img src="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/anndata.png" alt="anndata" border="0" height=500></a>

We have a variant effect score for each of the 37 genes in the interval and each
of the 667 `RNA_SEQ` tracks:
"""

variant_scores.X.shape

"""We can access information on the 37 genes using `.obs`. Here are just first 5
genes:
"""

variant_scores.obs.head()

"""Note that if you are using a variant scorer that is not gene-specific (i.e., a
`variant_scorers.CenterMaskScorer`), then `variant_scores.X` would have shape
`(1, 667)` and there will be no gene metadata available since there is no
concept of genes in this scenario.

The description of each track is accessed using `.var` (this is the same
dataframe as the output metadata, but is included alongside the variant scores
for convenience):
"""

variant_scores.var

"""Some handy additional metadata can be found in `.uns`:"""

print(f'Interval: {variant_scores.uns["interval"]}')
print(f'Variant: {variant_scores.uns["variant"]}')
print(f'Variant scorer: {variant_scores.uns["variant_scorer"]}')

"""We recommend interacting with variant scores by flattening `AnnData` objects
using `tidy_scores`, which produces a dataframe with each row being a single
score for each combination of (variant, gene, scorer, ontology). It optionally
excludes stranded tracks which do not match the geneâ€™s strand for gene-specific
scorer.

The `raw_score` column contains the same values as stored in `variant_scores.X`.
The `quantile_score` column is the rank of the `raw_score` in the distribution
of scores for a background set of common variants, represented as a quantile
probability. This allows for direct comparison across variant scoring strategies
that yield scores on different scales. See
[FAQs](https://www.alphagenomedocs.com/faqs.html#what-is-the-difference-between-a-quantile-score-and-raw-score)
for further details.

"""## Highlighting important regions with *in silico* mutagenesis

To highlight which regions in a DNA sequence are functionally important for a
final variant prediction, we can perform an **in silico mutagenesis** (ISM)
analysis by scoring all possible single nucleotide variants in a specific
interval.

Here is a visual overview of this process:

want to systematically mutate. We also define the `sequence_interval`, which is
the contextual interval the model will use when making predictions for each
variant.

ism_interval = sequence_interval.resize(256)

"""Next, we define the scorer we want to use to score each of the ISM variants.

each variant's effect on DNA accessibility in the 500bp vicinity. See the
[variant scoring documentation](https://www.alphagenomedocs.com/variant_scoring.html)
